A very simple MIPS assembly program, developed in the MARS MIPS Simulator, that has five different options, after reading an integer N from input:
1)It will print the numbers in the following format:
  1
  1 2 
  1 2 ... N
2)It will calculate if N is odd or even, printing the result to the screen.
3)Read 5 different numbers, and print each number multiplied by 4.
4)Read a string from 1 to 100 characters, and swap uppercase/lowercase letters.
5)Exit from the program.

The above requirement were given to me by an excercise at my University, as part of the class for the Digital Computer Theory.
