A very simple MIPS assembly program, developed in the MARS MIPS Simulator, that has five different options, after reading an integer N from input:
<br>1)It will print the numbers in the following format:
<br>  1
<br>  1 2 
<br>  1 2 ... N
<br>2)It will calculate if N is odd or even, printing the result to the screen.
<br>3)Read 5 different numbers, and print each number multiplied by 4.
<br>4)Read a string from 1 to 100 characters, and swap uppercase/lowercase letters.
<bbr>5)Exit from the program.

<br>The above requirement were given to me by an excercise at my University, as part of the class for the Digital Computer Theory.
